### 🧠 Overview

### 🛡️ Defensive Security Intro
- Learned the basics of how cyber defenders monitor, investigate, and respond to threats using tools like SIEM.
- Explored core concepts like threat intelligence, malware analysis, digital forensics, and the role of a SOC team.

### 👥 SOC Fundamentals  
- Learned how SOC teams operate, including alert triage, escalation workflows, and roles from L1 Analyst to SOC Manager.  
- Explored how tools like SIEM, EDR, and firewalls work together in detecting and responding to threats in real-world environments. 

### 🔍 Digital Forensics Fundamentals  
- Learned the four key phases of digital forensics (Collection, Examination, Analysis, Reporting) using tools like Autopsy and Volatility.  
- Practised reading metadata, analysing disk and memory images, and preserving evidence integrity with write blockers and chain of custody principles.

### 🚨 Incident Response Fundamentals  
- Explored the full lifecycle of responding to a security incident using industry frameworks like SANS PICERL and NIST.  
- Investigated a phishing attack in a hands-on lab, focusing on detection, containment, and applying real-world incident handling techniques.

### 📜 Logs Fundamentals  
- Learned how logs serve as crucial evidence in cyber investigations, from login records to web server access details.  
- Explored how to read and filter logs using tools like Event Viewer and `grep`, and saw how they reveal attacker behaviour and system events.
